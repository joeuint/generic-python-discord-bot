Generic Python Discord Bot (feel free to call it GPDB for short) is a open source, multipurpose discord bot written in python using the [discord.py wrapper](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## Features
- Polls
- Moderation
- Fun commands
- Verification using captchas
- And more to come

## Setup
### Before starting, ensure you have [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads) installed.  
To get this bot going simply install the following packages (sorry working on adding requirments.txt)
- dotenv
- discord.py

You then want to run the bot by simply running `python bot.py`.  
If you are on mac or the above command does not work, try `python3 bot.py`.
